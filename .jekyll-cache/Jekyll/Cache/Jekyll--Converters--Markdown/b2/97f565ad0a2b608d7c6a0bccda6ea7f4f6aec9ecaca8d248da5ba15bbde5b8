<p>Data acquisition, which is abbreviated to DAQ is a process of obtaining data that measure real-world physical phenomena into a digital form to be processed by a computer. This data could be either digital or analog. Digital inputs get the data from state changes in the circuit. For example in volatage measurement it could be presence (+5V) and absence (0V) of the voltage. The analogue readings could be variables that continuously vary such as temperature, speed, pressure, temperature or sounds that can be measured in terms of a voltage or a current.</p>

<p>PCI-6621 is a multifunction I/O device from the M Series by National Instruments. It is an ideal choice for Data Acquisition. The PCI-6221 DAQ Card can be used with an NI-DAQ mx driver and configuration utility to simplify the configuration and measurement process. There are two variants of PCI-6221 DAQ Cards:</p>

<p>The DAQ card is connected to the Computer via Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) interface, which is the most common way to attach add-on controller cards and other devices to a computer motherboard. ‚ÄúLabVIEW‚Äù by National Instruments can be used as the design platform to visualize the measurements.</p>
