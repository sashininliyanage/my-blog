## What is Agile methodology?
Agile methodology is an approach to software development that follows set of values and principles which are described in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/manifesto.html) for software development. Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development. It is dividing a project into several phases. At the end of each phase, there should be a deliverable product. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage.


<!-- Agile methodologies aim to deliver the right product, with incremental and frequent delivery of small chunks of functionality, through small cross-functional self-organizing teams, enabling frequent customer feedback and course correction as needed.

In doing so, Agile aims to right the challenges faced by the traditional “waterfall” approaches of delivering large products in long periods of time, during which customer requirements frequently changed, resulting in the wrong products being delivered. -->
